Job title: Humanitarian 
Job location: Atlanta, GA, US
Job description: 
The Program Follows Three Mutually Enforcing Objectives
CARE is a leading humanitarian and development organization dedicated to fighting poverty and social injustice with a special emphasis on human rights, gender equality and women and girls. One of CARE’s flagship gender-transformative programs is the “Pathways to Empowerment” program, a $15,000,000, 60-month grant with the overall goal of increasing poor women smallholder farmers’ productivity and empowerment in more equitable agriculture systems at scale. It is being implemented in six diverse countries – Malawi, Tanzania, Mali, Ghana, India, and Bangladesh. The program builds on and is inspired by the vital roles that women play around the world in smallholder agriculture, meeting the food and nutrition needs of their household and contributing to economic development. This integrated program combines the themes of women’s empowerment, systems change, value chain development, and sustainable agriculture, with a strong research and learning component.
  Increase the productivity and empowerment of 150,000 poor women farmers in sustainable and equitable agricultural systems
  Enhance the scale of high-quality, women- responsive agriculture programming
  Influence debates and policy dialogue on women and agriculture at local, national and global levels
Pathways activity programming follows CARE’s women’s empowerment framework, which looks for interventions to strengthen women’s agency; create gender-equitable structures (including norms); and improve equity in relationships. Working with men and boys is a critical lever of change, and it represents a relatively new area of programming for CARE and in development in general.
The vision of the Pathways program is one of empowered women farmers who have the resources, capacities, and enabling the environment to achieve secure and resilient livelihoods and sustainable futures for their households, themselves and communities.
CARE is seeking to hire a Technical Advisor, Gender and Livelihoods who will work under the mentorship of the Pathways Program Team Leader, and the Director of Agriculture and Market Systems.
