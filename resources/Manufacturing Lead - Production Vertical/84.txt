Thank you very much in advance for submitting your resume. If you are submitting your resume on our website, there is a section marked 'Cover Letter?. Please add your answers to our candidate pre-screening questions in this section when you apply. You will find the pre-screening questions at the bottom of the job description.
If you apply on line to a customer, your name gets logged into their computer system and then when we submit you, it comes back to us rejected as a duplicate - and there is no guarantee that your online submittal gets reviewed in a timely manner - or at all. It is simply a function of how many human and software resources they have or don't have to review hundreds of online submittals. That is why firms engage outside staffing suppliers such as GTA in order to help them through the maze of applicants. Stick with GTA and we will get your resume in front of those who can decide. That would include the HR or Recruiting Manager ? and more importantly, the hiring manager.
We will get back to you as soon as the customer provides feedback. Thank you for choosing GTA as your job search partner.
