This role reports directly to our Chief Information Security Officer.
Your Day

· Provide deep technical and security advice to teams inside the paranoids and across the company.
What You Bring

· A history of being a catalyst for positive security change in medium to large technology and/or internet focused companies.
· Excellent written and verbal communication and listening skills, with a history of successful negotiation, influence, and conflict resolution in disparate organizations with competing incentives.
· The proven ability to design and deploy complex systems from scratch and from parts.
· Experience leading and managing across geographical and administrative boundaries.
· Experience working at and building for Internet scale including measuring the impact, performance, health, and stability of large monolithic and distributed systems.
· Deep expertise with some cryptographic protocols, implementations, vulnerabilities, usability, and performance characteristics in real world systems.
· A portfolio of solutions that show security and usability are not mutually exclusive.
· A good understanding of the human aspects of information security including basic psychology, cognitive biases, heuristics, decision making, and user experience / design.
· Working knowledge of modern c, c++, java, javascript, and/or golang, and automated build, test and deployment systems for the same.
· Experience with threat and attack modeling of large and varied systems against modern, global threats including varied threat actors’ tools, techniques, and practices, an understanding of the legal requirements and climate across the globe, and a great sense of how to balance preventative and detective controls and company productivity.
· A deep, current knowledge of technology - networks, operating systems, browser and web security, cloud and software defined networking considerations, varied application stacks, distributed systems, and programming languages and environments.
· Some college is likely required, but we're much more interested in your accomplishments, security acumen, experience (particularly at scale), motivation, leadership skills, and ability to work well with others.
