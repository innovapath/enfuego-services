<body><p class="s3"><b>Director of Creative Services</b></p>
<p class="s4"><a name="_dbbxirwbnmka" /><a name="_7akb65luvz0x" /><i>Who are we?</i></p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">Resound is a creative agency that helps our clients tell their authentic stories and create remarkable customer experiences.Our team is just small enough to fit perfectly in the <a href="https://mac6.com/conscious-workspace/offices/">awesome Tempe co-working space</a> that we (along with other startups and small businesses) call home. We’ve got a Chemex for delicious coffee, a Wii, lots of craft beer, <i>and</i> an on-site gym...doesn’t get much better than that.  </p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">We’ve already been around for seven years and we’re in “growth mode.” That should explain why we’re so passionate about seeking out new talent. Our clients include Infusionsoft, Shamrock Foods, Canyon State Credit Union, and several other small-to-medium-sized businesses and non-profits. Recently, we completed a rebrand of the accounting firm Henry+Horne.  We love collaborating with people who show up, work hard, and love refining their craft...we also love Deschutes craft beer and Chipotle.</p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">So if you’re still reading this, apply already!  We’ve got a lot of work to do.</p>
<p class="normal_(Web)" />
<p class="s4"><a name="_ys134jvu42w5" /><i>Who are you?</i></p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">Are you a strategically relational person? Do you love to guide marketing managers, executives, and owners toward creating amazing brands? Do you stay in touch with clients and make they feel appreciated while also making sure all the details of projects are getting taken care of?</p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">Do you also love to groom and expand creative teams? Do you have experience giving people the tools, advice, and encouragement they need to reach beyond their potential? (And do you secretly love to write great marketing copy?)</p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">If this is resonates, you might be Resound’s new Director of Client Services!</p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">Your Mission (should you choose to accept it) is to:  </p>
<p>● Groom and grow relationships with our clients and their companies. These often include owners, CEO/Presidents, CMOs, Marketing Directors, and any staff on the marketing team.</p>
<p>● Lead brand and website strategy workshops with clients and make sure that everyone is clear on the vision, goals, audience, and desired outcomes of each project.</p>
<p>● Look for and recommend additional branding and marketing initiatives to our clients that would help them to grow their own customer relationships and make their brands even more remarkable.</p>
<p>● Facilitate clear and empathetic communication between clients and our internal creative and web development teams.</p>
<p>● Lead all internal client-related meetings, staying aware of all client projects, their status and deliverables.</p>
<p>● Work with our Project Manager on high-level project changes that may affect schedule and/or scope. Then communicate well any cost and/or timeline increases to the client.</p>
<p>● Support our Managing Partner on high-priority proposal pitches to new clients. This would include helping to prepare proposal and presentation content and materials, attending presentation meetings, and assisting with the pitch.</p>
<p>● Lead the creative and web development teams, looking for opportunities to help each individual grow as a creative and a professional.</p>
<p>● Help develop (alongside the Project Manager and Managing Partner) overall processes for different types of projects as well as hand-offs internally between the creative and web development teams.</p>
<p>● Look for and instigate opportunities to grow Resound’s culture—both inside and outside the company.</p>
<p>● Concept and write marketing content, training material, and sales collateral for the Resound brand alongside the Managing Partner and Copywriter/Marketing Specialist</p>
<p>●  </p>
<p class="s12"><a name="_kl3a9igzamh7" />This is a full-time, salaried position. We’re looking for candidates with at least 5 years of account management, and/or creative director experience, preferably at a creative, marketing, or advertising agency. Experience leading branding (or rebranding) initiatives is a plus.</p>
<p class="s4"><a name="_7k9l3ud4qwcd" /><i>Benefits</i></p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">We provide group health, dental, and life insurance, profit-sharing, paid vacation &amp; holidays, unlimited puns and ‘dad’ jokes, and free access to a gym on location. Oh and you might get a free Taftly shirt.</p>
<p class="s4"><a name="_mezmuu8go277" /><i>Let’s get together  </i></p>
<p class="normal_(Web)">We’re looking for you.  Well, we sure hope it’s you. If you just happen to be looking for us too, well then, how convenient! If you’re interested (and you are – trust us), give us a shout at <a href="mailto:jobs@resoundcreative.com">jobs@resoundcreative.com</a>.</p>
