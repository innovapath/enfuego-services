Financial Recovery Technologies has become a trusted partner to hedge funds, mutual funds, custodians, sovereign wealth funds, and other institutional investment firms, and our best-in-class people and technology have made FRT a market leader. As a Paralegal/Legal Product Specialist, you will build a network of deep relationships with global case organizers and attorneys and serve as an operational specialist for FRT’s global product, facilitating and streamlining our clients’ assessment of and participation in overseas securities and antitrust cases.
The Role: As a Paralegal/Legal Product Specialist at FRT, you will provide critical operational support to our FRT Global team by:
· Ensuring our clients have the information they need in order to decide whether and how to participate in global securities and antitrust cases
· Help maintain a fully up-to-date database of relevant legal matters pending in various jurisdictions to make sure our clients are aware of every possible opportunity
· Through legal and internet research and through relationships with our partner networks, gather information necessary for clients to make informed participation decisions
· Synthesize information gathered to prepare client alerts for review and distribution
· Facilitating and streamlining our clients’ analysis of and participation in non-U.S. litigation matters
· Manage and track all workflows associated with our FRT Global and FRT Direct products – track what alerts were sent to whom and when, ensure clients who respond to alerts receive necessary information, and track all case events and relevant deadlines

· Build a network of deep relationship with global case organizers and attorneys
· Maintain regular contact with organizers to share case information and updates, loss analyses, participation documents, and any other information necessary to respond to inquiries and facilitate participation
Our ideal candidate is:
· Highly organized – you find the idea of tracking and coordinating multiple workflows across departments to be an exciting challenge rather than an overwhelming crisis;
· A phenomenal task juggler, able to balance multiple at-times-competing demands;
· Genuinely interested in legal issues – while a JD, bachelor’s in legal studies, or a paralegal certificate (or work experience in a legal setting) are not required, any of them would be a plus;
· Self-directed and detail oriented, with strong analytical, problem solving, and creative thinking skills;
· A strong writer and communicator;
· Collaborative and interested in building strong relationships with peers across corporate functions;
· Intellectually curious, with a demonstrated commitment to continuous growth; and
· Of course, looking to join a growing company with a vibrant, entrepreneurial culture, dedicated to being the top provider in the class action recovery space.
