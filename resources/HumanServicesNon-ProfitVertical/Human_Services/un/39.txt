MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership 

Job title: Humanitarian 
Job location: Lincoln, NE , US
Job description: 
Program Name: Strengths for Life Mentoring Program
A SFL mentor is a caring adult who intentionally spends time with a student and invests in their life to help them become the person God created them to be.
What's different about SFL Mentoring?
1-Faith-based - Our mentors will be more than simply a friend. When a mentor shares God's unconditional love, mentoring can reach new heights.
2-Volunteer-Friendly - We understand that a person's life can be full of church commitments, work demands, family time, and other important things. Rather than a weekly commitment required by most other mentoring programs, we ask for a minimum of a monthly commitment for at least one year. However, additional meetings are allowed and highly encouraged. City Impact students are already receiving weekly instruction in our Bible Club and Impact Leadership Academy, thus the less frequent mentoring requirement.
3-Strengths Development - At City Impact, our approach to mentoring is to look beyond the negative influences that often surround low-income students. To do this, we turn the student's attention to their God-given gifts and talents through interest-based activities and interest-focused college and career exploration.
City Impact is an evangelical, Christian, humanitarian organization seeking to meet physical and spiritual needs in Lincoln's urban neighborhoods. Because of the unique nature of our ministry, we require that our mentors be a part of a faith community.
For insurance purposes, we require that all mentors have a valid driver's license, own the vehicle that they will be transporting their mentee in and have auto insurance that includes passenger liability.
