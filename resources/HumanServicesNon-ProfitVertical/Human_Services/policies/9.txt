Stichting Boots On The Ground

Job title: Humanitarian
Job location: Noble, OK, US
Job description: 
Our core operational volunteer leaders are composed of individuals heavily trained and experienced in highly specialized areas including disaster management, emergency and primary medicine, global security, counter-insurgency, and civil affairs operations. Most are former active duty military personnel who’ve deployed all over the world. Their mission is to recruit, develop, and insert highly skilled teams into local communities to set up programs to meet our primary mission and humanitarian goals.
Our front line rapid response teams are made up of highly dedicated and motivated volunteers from a variety of backgrounds, many of whom have served in conflict theaters while in uniform. One of our primary missions is to empower returning veterans with opportunities to use the skills they developed while in the military, to serve others in need during disaster recovery operations both domestically in the United States, and abroad.
Like our front line or operational responders, our support volunteers also come from a variety of backgrounds, and possess a broad range of skills and abilities that are essential to BOTG’s strategic, operational, and ground-level success. They come from all walks of life ranging the gamut from retired educators and homemakers, to students and C-level executives. We depend very highly on those who can offer their time, knowledge, experience, and finances to further our common goals.
In an emergency you'll be there to help when someone needs it most. We provide free training to the right people-so they can help make a difference.
Our BOTG Disaster Response Teams (BOTG-DRTs) are entirely staffed by volunteer members specially trained to deploy domestically and around the world. We've deployed all over the world-you can too.
The primary goal of BOTG-DRT members is to help the greatest number of people as effectively as possible during rapid response missions after major natural or man-made disasters. Volunteers can be an asset, but they can also be a hindrance-depending on if they're prepared, trained, and organized-or not.
Responsibilities
Responsibilities vary considerably according to the nature of the situation, but can include
Typically our BOTG-DRT members operate in front line conditions and facilitating the effective distribution of humanitarian aid to people in need.
· rapidly assessing emergency situations; working closely with staff located within the area or other emergency departments
· coordinating and supporting the work of volunteers
· managing budgets
· managing the implementation of emergency activities and monitoring their effectiveness
· producing response reports, recommendations and proposals for emergency intervention
· developing and monitoring objectives
· liaising with United Nations agencies, government officials, colleagues etc
· recruiting/managing local staff
· organizing induction, support and training for volunteers/other aid workers
· implementing, overseeing and ensuring strict adherence with security/safety procedures
· ensuring knowledge of and compliance with appropriate national and international procedures, policies and regulatory codes
· making representations to donors, local authorities and humanitarian community members
· producing funding proposals
Qualifications And Training Required
Specialist knowledge is important, and good degrees in subjects such as medicine, engineering, languages or social sciences can be useful. But we accept volunteers from all backgrounds-especially those who've served in uniform. And we train them to standard so they can impact people's lives, rather than becoming at risk themselves in disaster zones.
