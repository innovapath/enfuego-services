Gershoni Creative Industry

Job title :Office Manager 
Job location : San Francisco Bay Area
Employer name : Gershoni Creative Industry
Job description: 
Our ideal candidate is some one who thrives in a small agency environment. Working directly with a close knit team of creatives, your role is to be the heartbeat of the agency. You will spearhead office operations, maintain and improve studio upkeep and supplies, manage internal databases and refine office systems. You’ll work on calendars, make travel arrangements, work with a variety of vendors and manage event coordination. You will be at the epicenter of all studio activities. 
You have a meticulous eye for detail and you love when things flow - professionally and personally. When they don't, you're the first to notice and you figure out just how to get things back on track.
You are proactive, highly organized, self-driven and expect the best from yourself. You love design, and even though you yourself are not a designer, you understand the ins and outs of working with a variety of creative personalities. You are a natural “connector” and just “get” people - you genuinely see the cup half full, even under pressure. 
You're looking for a job where no two days are the same and you want to grow with a company. You like to solve problems and you want to work as an integral part of a team that makes great things happen.

You have:
· deep organizational skills with an eye for consistency, quality, and order. 
· outstanding customer/client service ethic. 
· professional communication skills - listening, verbal and written. 
· the ability to take direction, work independently, and carry out responsibilities accurately and efficiently. 
· the ability to multi-task and thrive in a deadline driven environment. 
· dedication to personal and professional accountability - you ask questions, learn quickly and find solutions. 
· complete comfort with the computer (Mac a must!), including the MS package and the social scenes. 
· curiosity – the drive to always be learning and growing, professionally and personally. 
· warm and friendly personality and a wicked sense of humor. 
· an interest in the wild world of design, branding, marketing, and art.
