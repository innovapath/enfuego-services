<p>Scott Farmer
Marketing &amp; Creative Director
</p>
<p>3 person has recommended Scott
"While at my previous employer, I hired Kinetix Group to help us with rapid development of a
comprehensive branding plan in support of a total website upgrade and Hubspot marketing program. Scott
was a master of extracting the core essentials of our brand and, more importantly, why our customers should
care. "
</p>
<p>— Paul Hughes, MBA, C.O.O. and Board Director, Guardian 8 Corporation, managed Scott at Kinetix
Group, LLC - Marketing &amp; Creative Services
</p>
<p>"When I need expert and balanced guidance for my clients marketing needs I call Scott. Insightful, creative,
and professional are just a few qualities he possesses. His ability to design a comprehensive marketing
approach from data and see it through all aspects of production is remarkable. I know my clients save both
time and money from his expertise. Scott's ability to analyze a clients current plan, understand the disconnects
while suggesting a way forward is rare and valuable to any firm. To get his type of insight firms typically
have several staff members. I appreciate that Scott has been in the owners chair, managed staff, dealt with
bankers and payroll, and designed many digital and print campaigns for a variety of markets and clientele.
From my perspective, this has given Scott great insight into business and what works and does not work in
marketing and how to grow businesses. I have come to rely upon his ability, for both myself and my clients,
to clearly see the finished product from the very start. I recommend Scott with two words: Unique, Valuable.
"
</p>
<p>— Christine Dura, CEO and Founder, Dura Consulting, worked with Scott at Kinetix Group, LLC -
Marketing &amp; Creative Services
</p>
<p>"Whenever I need something done well, and especially when it needs to be fast and right, I turn to Scott. He
listens to our design needs, recommends options based on current best practices, and then delivers excellent
work. Many times I couldn't have done it without him. A great eye, excellent design sense, and always very
professional."
</p>
<p>— Ran Farmer, Senior Managing Director, ARPC, was Scott's client
