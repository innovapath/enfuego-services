CAD-CAM
Job title : Manufacturing Lead
Job location : Charlotte, NC, US


Employer name :
Job description :
SR CNC MANUFACTURING ENGINEER 80-85k plus bonuses
Best way to describe job is "CNC Guru" and I swore id never us that term as long as I live , like calling a person named "Precious" by their proper name. But very growing, expanding high tech facility needs lead MFG engineer to handle all aspects of a MFG a shop. MGT skills helpful, tooling , machine operations, supervision of others helpful, position on north side of charlotte so those in Mooresville possibly. Any software ok, such as mastercam, gibbscam, esprit, catia etc.. but must be confident, sharp with good record of job stability and normal temperament, not brittle . Great opportunity
Majority of position is 25% programming, the rest a combination of NEW set ups and machine optimization. Must know SolidWorks, work closely with QC, on site ME Engineer and Production Manager. Some autocad on site but not a must . Excellent communication skills, team player and company man a must. Will mostly design fixturing, programming, order tooling, keep machines running (so good if they can do some repair on machines). Must be flexible. This person should be a FANUC controls expert. He/she will be the one who will be responsible for keeping machines running so he should know the guts of the machine. He/she should be able to install and integrate that into a machine. . Opportunities to deal with customer face to face on prototypes, so must be presentable. Work will be prioritized by production manager, so must be able to change gears. Must be respected by machinists with a good attitude. Want long term person. Must be able to optimize programs and work with company ERP. (We will now be able to accurately measure and cost jobs). So, this person’s work will be able to be measured.
We have 4 jr. programmer/set up guys, so this person will not be doing simple set ups or repeat part set ups. He/she will only be involved in NEW setups of complex parts. But will be designing fixturing for it.
hurry!! CAD/CAM RECRUITERS , since 1981 is not on any networks etc so resumes stays with JUST us and confidential
