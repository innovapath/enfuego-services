Project Description
Mercy Corps alleviates poverty, suffering, and oppression and works to build secure, productive, and just communities in over 40 countries around the world. Our Program Department supports field-led work that delivers measurable impact.
Mercy Corps’ Technical Support Unit (TSU) is a key part of the Program Department. TSU subject-matter experts help set agency strategy and provide consultation – from assessment and design through project implementation and results measurement – to field offices worldwide, in some of the world’s toughest places. TSU team members lead research, foster organizational learning, represent Mercy Corps to external audiences, and develop partnerships. The TSU is also integral to global business development and revenue.
The TSU includes five composite teams. The Youth, Gender & Girls (Y2G) Team and the Health, Nutrition & WASH Team are one composite team. The Y2G Team focuses on the “who” for the agency. The team is really about being intentional about who we target in communities (men, women, boys and girls), how, why and with what/when. We work closely with other TSU teams and field teams to be deliberate about who and how. The Health, Nutrition and WASH Team leads and supports our field teams to implement effectively integrate health and nutrition outcomes within multi sectoral programs, as well as drive innovation and quality in our humanitarian responses in the areas of water and maternal/child health.
