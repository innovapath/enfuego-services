<p>6 people have recommended Geoff
</p>
<p>"I've worked with Geoff for several years now, initially at eBay and now at PayPal. I've always found Geoff
</p>
<p>to be professional in his conduct and amazingly timely in his communications. He excels at managing
</p>
<p>interactions with VIPs and executives. He has a clam and focused demeanor that's strategic and results driven.
</p>
<p>Call it a white glove approach to client services. If you have the chance to work with Geoff I can guarantee
</p>
<p>that you will find it to be an enjoyable experience."

<p>— Devin Whitney, Senior Manager, State Government Relations, PayPal, was Geoff's client

</p>
<p>political environments. Geoff was instrumental in the passage of Arizona's Data Center Incentive legislation.
</p>
<p>His ability to build coalitions and achieve results has been a tremendous benefit to Arizona's technology
</p>
<p>industry. I would highly recommend Geoff to any organization seeking to partner with a result orientated

</p>
<p>"It is without reservation that I recommend Geoff to organizations who are looking for a pragmatic thinker,
</p>
<p>who knows how to roll up his sleeves and simultaneously lead a project with a team oriented approach. We
</p>
<p>had the opportunity to work with each other closely, while we lobbied for a progressive data center incentive
</p>
<p>program in Arizona in 2012/2013. The leadership delivered by Geoff was instrumental in creating a coalition
</p>
<p>of data center operators to deliver a Bill which eventually passed in June 2013. Geoff's ability to listen to a
</p>
<p>client's needs; develop multiple solutions and execute with the mindset of the clients short and long terms is
</p>
<p>without rival. "
