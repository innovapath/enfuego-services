Job title: Humanitarian 
Job location: New York City, NY, US
Job description: 
The New Aid Modalities team builds and broadens relations with multi-lateral institutions and non-traditional donors to identify and develop new financing strategies and opportunities for child-focused investments under the wider umbrella of the SDG agenda and Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. The ‘business cycle’ of partnership development with the international finance community ranges from strategic discussions and analysis (monitoring and development of new innovative financing models, typically at the intersection of public and private sources of finance), resource mobilization (negotiation and design of new partnership models, guidance to country offices and partners) to implementation (grant administration, monitoring of funds flows, etc).
UNICEF works in 190 countries and territories to protect the rights of every child. UNICEF has spent 70 years working to improve the lives of children and their families. Defending children's rights throughout their lives requires a global presence, aiming to produce results and understand their effects. UNICEF believes all children have a right to survive, thrive and fulfill their potential – to the benefit of a better world.
For every child, partnerships
The Public Partnerships Division (PPD) is developing strengthened public partnerships through evidence-based policy advocacy and resource mobilization for realizing children's rights in the context of UNICEF Strategic Plan. The Division continue positioning children at the heart of the Agenda 2030 and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The PPD facilitates UNICEF's work with other UN agencies, as we position ourselves to be fit for results in the context of the new Quadrennial Comprehensive Policy Review, including efforts to engage in a more robust humanitarian, development and peace nexus. The work is focused to facilitate and foster current relationships while building new partnerships. For example, strengthen strategic relationships with International Financial Institutions (IFIs), Global Programme Partnerships (GPPs), Emerging Economies, and regional powers, and continue exploring innovative financing arrangements.
The Activities Of The Team Can Be Divided Into Three Main Fields
The New Aid Modalities team builds and broadens relations with multi-lateral institutions and non-traditional donors to identify and develop new financing strategies and opportunities for child-focused investments under the wider umbrella of the SDG agenda and Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing for Development. The 'business cycle' of partnership development with the international finance community ranges from strategic discussions and analysis (monitoring and development of new innovative financing models, typically at the intersection of public and private sources of finance), resource mobilization (negotiation and design of new partnership models, guidance to country offices and partners) to implementation (grant administration, monitoring of funds flows, etc).
  Global Programme Partnerships
Global Programme Partnerships are programmes that are supported by at least two partners with shared objectives, which have their own partnership governing bodies and, most often, are multi-country in operational scope. UNICEF has been working closely with GPPs on issues relevant to the promotion and protection of the rights of the child, particularly with Gavi, Global Fund, Global Partnership for Education, Micronutrient Initiative etc.
  International Financial Institutions
UNICEF's engagement with International Financial Institutions encompasses policy dialogue, joint analysis and advocacy on shared priority areas, as well as programme collaboration at the country, regional and global levels. Opportunities for engagement will continue to increase, as many IFIs are adopting new strategic priorities that align well with UNICEF's mandate.
  Innovative Finance
The New Aid Modalities Team, jointly with PFP and DFAM, are UNICEF HQ's focal points on innovative finance. UNICEF focuses on exploring innovative financing mechanisms for the benefit of partner countries in underfunded and cross-cutting areas of the child rights agenda.
