<p>Eric Myers
Director of Creative Services at Resound Creative
</p>
<p>Summary
I have experience serving multiple Fortune Global 500 companies as well as small/medium businesses in
 the areas of client services, account and team leadership, training, facilitation, content development, event
 marketing, and sales. While that may sound like a potpourri of skills and abilities, here are four points that
 summarize my core competencies:
</p>
<p>1. Over my 10+ years of “corporate” experience, regardless of position or job title, I have routinely been at the
 forefront of client services on a daily basis, often being personally requested by clients during the bid process
 or after a project was awarded. 
</p>
<p>2. My law enforcement experience provides an intangible leadership “draw” that often results in teammates
 looking to me for guidance during stressful situations. Because of this, tightly-knit teams that work diligently
 and with excellence tend to develop around me.
</p>
<p>3. I have been the go-to person for developing RFP responses and leading sales presentations in the creative
 services industry. This resulted in higher close rates and growing company revenue year-over-year. I also have
 experience selling a tangible product in the healthcare, education, and security industries, which resulted in the
 company’s largest sale.
</p>
<p>4. Every DiSC, Plum, or Myers-Briggs assessment I’ve taken lists communication as my strongest skill. I have
 seen this play out in my law enforcement and corporate experience as I have been able to successfully adapt my
 communication style based on the person and the situation before me. In my experience, this chameleon-like
 ability does not come easy to everyone.

<p>1 person has recommended Eric
"It is my pleasure to recommend Eric Myers. His ever-present consummate client-focused performance
working as a Vice President at automatik proved to be invaluable to us during the time we worked together.
I have known Eric for 5+ years in my capacity as a Toyota Product Education Manager at the Toyota
Headquarters in Torrance, California. In his capacity at automatik, Eric managed all of the creative and
dealer-facing training curriculum for 6 very high-profile vehicle launch projects (Scion and Toyota
brands). His performance and execution in both managing his team and face to face interactions with
Toyota management and executives, would rank him as one the best "organized" creative minds that I have
ever interacted with in my 38 years with Toyota Motor Sales. Eric distinguished himself by consistently
demonstrating exceptionally well-organized development and executions of all the projects he managed. Eric
is exceptionally intelligent, has strong communication skills and has a mature approach to assimilating and
understanding clients' needs, pro-actively . If his performance during his collaboration with Toyota is a good
indication of how he would perform in other professional capacities,he would be an extremely positive asset
to any company. If I can be of any further assistance, or provide you with any specific information, please do
not hesitate to contact me. Yours Sincerely, Suzanne Abel "
