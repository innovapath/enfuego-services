Job location: Africa, IN, US
Job description: 
UN Women, grounded in the vision of equality enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, works for the elimination of discrimination against women and girls; the empowerment of women; and the achievement of equality between women and men as partners and beneficiaries of development, human rights, humanitarian action and peace and security.
UN Women is committed to the achievement of equality between women, men, boys and girls as partners and beneficiaries of humanitarian action. In October 2012, UN Women established its Gender and Humanitarian Action Unit to consolidate its advocacy, coordination and capacity development role for the integration of gender equality across humanitarian action. This includes disaster risk reduction with a focus on prevention, mitigation and preparedness, humanitarian response and early recovery. Humanitarian crises are not gender neutral. Evidence demonstrates a strong and consistent relationship between gender equality and hunger. Women and girls represent 60% of all undernourished people in the world. Pregnant and lactating women need to consume more calories to support the development of their babies and the production of breast milk. Babies born by malnourished mothers are likely to have low birth weight, which is one of the strongest predictors of whether a child will die before the age of five. Divorce rates increase during food shortages. This leaves women and children to fend for themselves. Female headed-households are particularly vulnerable. Yields for women farmers are 20-30 % lower for women than for men as they have less access to improved seeds, fertilizers and equipment. Daughters are married off sooner during food shortage, and are then more likely to become pregnant while malnourished, and die during childbirth. Conflict and humanitarian crises increases the risk of sexual violence affecting both women and men. Thus, gender sensitive humanitarian response is essential to improve the effectiveness of humanitarian assistance, through better targeted support.
The 2016 World Humanitarian Summit acknowledged that in line with the SDGs ‘reaching those left furthest behind first’ through a mixture of short-, medium-, and longer term assistance is a priority.
Protracted conflict has become the new normal. The humanitarian crisis in Iraq remains one of the largest and most volatile in the world. The pace of displacement over the past three years is nearly without precedent. In 2014, 2 million civilians were displaced in Iraq; in 2015, an additional 1.4 million were forced to flee. During the past year, more than 650,000 people in areas impacted by the conflict with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) have been newly displaced. Security threats, changes in climate, and population movements have caused a worsening food security situation in several countries. In Somalia, 6.2 million people are food insecure, 2.9 million in emergency and crisis, 3.3 million in stressed food security situations. In South Sudan, 100.000 people face famine, 1 million is on the brink of famine and 5 million urgently need food and livelihood assistance. In North-East Nigeria 5.1 million people urgently need food and livelihood assistance. In Yemen, 7.3 million people urgently needs food assistance, of whom about 3.3 million children and pregnant or lactating women are acutely malnourished.
Shifts are emerging around how humanitarian assistance is delivered, as more effective solutions need to be found to address those left furthest behind. Also, there is an increasing realisation that the humanitarian-development nexus need to be addressed as people need humanitarian assistance and support to reduce risk, build resilience, and prepare for disaster both in the short-, medium, and long term, given the nature of many of the current conflicts, and given the threats posed by climate change and natural disasters. As crises are not gender neural, response should address the needs of women as they differ from those of men.
UN Women is engaged in efforts to establish a Cash Based Initiative for women to enhance their access to resources and their ability to prioritize the use of these resources to address their needs and the needs of their children. UN Women intends to do this through two different approaches. One approach is through strategic partnerships. Through strategic partnerships with other UN entities and NGOs working on cash transfers, UN Women intends to strengthen targeted support to women as they represent the majority left furthest behind. Such strategic partnerships can entail technical capacity development support for gender responsive cash transfers, needs assessment as a key integral element of big cash transfers programs, and analysis on the impact for women and children. The other approach is to provide cash transfers to smaller, specific initiatives where more extensive technical support is required. This approach builds on and intends to expand current efforts to provide cash transfers to women especially through one-stop centers, as exemplified in Jordan where several thousand women were supported every month for resilience initiatives. Both approaches are interlinked as the needs assessment and analysis will be part and parcel of both approaches.
Under the supervision of the UN Women Chief of the Humanitarian Unit, and in close consultation with UN Women’s Innovation Team, UN Women HQ and Regional Humanitarian Advisors and Technical Experts, UN partner agencies, IASC Gender Reference Group members, civil society organisations engaged in cash transfers, and by building on initial work already done in UN Women on cash based transfers, the consultant will develop a Cash Based Transfers Strategy based on strategic partnership for humanitarian response, and an Implementation Plan. The consultancy will require 45 working days between 1 April and 30 June 2017.
