Job description: 
Team Rubicon (TR) is seeking a Deputy Director to guide the development and continued refinement of disaster capabilities that allow TR’s skilled, experienced, driven volunteer base to help people on their worst day. This position reports to the VP of Programs and Field Operations and is located at our National Headquarters in Los Angeles, CA.
The Capabilities lead will take on the analysis, selection, and development of new mission scope from a deep understanding of the disaster and humanitarian landscape and TR’s member base, to the focused selection of specific mission areas that drive the greatest possible impact. With the opportunity to lead and grow a team, this person will identify discrete capabilities, define TR’s practice, develop training to support, and identify the partnerships, equipment, and supply chain necessary to increase Team Rubicon’s scope of practice. As our member base and organizational capacity continues to grow, Team Rubicon aims to support communities in need in all aspects of the disaster cycle – Mitigation, Response, and Recovery.
In addition to new capabilities, the individual that fills this role will review, refine, and implement the results of after action reporting. In close coordination with Team Rubicon’s ten Regions and the National Operations Center, the capabilities team will analyze feedback, triage urgent items for immediate implementation, and define the process for annual capabilities review and update.
TR has a unique culture that requires individuals foolish enough to think they can change the world, and smart enough to have a chance. Every day is a challenge, but every month brings new opportunities for an organization that is quickly becoming a household name in disaster response. Candidates for the position are required to balance a team-player attitude with a strong command presence.
