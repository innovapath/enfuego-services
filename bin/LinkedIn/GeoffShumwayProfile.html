<p>Geoff Shumway
Vice President, Business Expansion at Arizona Commerce Authority
</p>
<p>6 people have recommended Geoff
"I've worked with Geoff for several years now, initially at eBay and now at PayPal. I've always found Geoff
to be professional in his conduct and amazingly timely in his communications. He excels at managing
interactions with VIPs and executives. He has a clam and focused demeanor that's strategic and results driven.
Call it a white glove approach to client services. If you have the chance to work with Geoff I can guarantee
that you will find it to be an enjoyable experience."
— Devin Whitney, Senior Manager, State Government Relations, PayPal, was Geoff's client
</p>
<p>"Geoff's greatest strengths are his ability to develop and maintain relationships, and navigate complex
political environments. Geoff was instrumental in the passage of Arizona's Data Center Incentive legislation.
His ability to build coalitions and achieve results has been a tremendous benefit to Arizona's technology
industry. I would highly recommend Geoff to any organization seeking to partner with a result orientated
leader with a track record of success."
</p>
<p>— Alan Kierman, Deputy General Counsel &amp; Assistant Secretary, IO, was with another company when
working with Geoff at Arizona Commerce Authority
</p>
<p>"It is without reservation that I recommend Geoff to organizations who are looking for a pragmatic thinker,
who knows how to roll up his sleeves and simultaneously lead a project with a team oriented approach. We
had the opportunity to work with each other closely, while we lobbied for a progressive data center incentive
program in Arizona in 2012/2013. The leadership delivered by Geoff was instrumental in creating a coalition
of data center operators to deliver a Bill which eventually passed in June 2013. Geoff's ability to listen to a
client's needs; develop multiple solutions and execute with the mindset of the clients short and long terms is
without rival. "

and delivering more than expected is one of his core strengths. Geoff's commitment to quality, his work
ethic, his focus, and his ability to find solutions to challenging problems through collaboration make him a

</p>
<p>"I have known Geoff for almost 10 years and his business acumen and professional demeanor are first class.
Geoff has an amazing ability to establish solid relationships and work with indivduals from all walks of life.
His ability to open doors and build relationships with individuals, organizations, and companies is a true
testament to not only his knowledge of any market sector, but his overall character as an individual. It was a
gret pleasure working with Geoff during our time at Pulte and I am sure if you get the opportunity to work
with him in the future, you will find that my remarks hold true."
