<p>Summary
When you grow up as the 8th child out of nine, you learn how to compete. Later, you reflect on how amazing
 your parents were in raising all those hungry mouths on one salary. That “bootstrap” sentiment is likely the
 reason that I joined the best of the best, the US Marines, and later earned an MBA from Arizona State and then
 went on to complete the Entrepreneurship Development program at MIT. 
</p>
<p>I'm a strong believer in the power of a good brand and the elegance of smooth operations being executed by a
 closely knit team pulling in the same direction. It takes patience, but the final product is worth the wait. 
</p>
<p>As the COO of Guardian 8, we started with an idea and carried that all the way through to a product launch
 in early 2014. Everything needed to be built from scratch...product, trusted manufacturing partners, investor
 support, a quality team that exists to this day, and a brand that went from zero recognition among security
 professionals to over 70% in less than a year.  I learned something about myself in my five years there: it's
 not what I do that matters to me, it's why I do it. Connecting with the mission of protecting others from pain,
 hunger, poverty or harm is essential for me.
</p>
<p>When it's ready for public viewing, my next passion project - Enfuego Technologies - is going to blow away job
 seekers who are asked to cram all of their existence into a 2-page résumé and submit it blindly, only to get a
 rejection letter 30 seconds after hitting "submit".  Coming soon!

<p>3 person has recommended Paul
"I had the pleasure of getting to know Paul while he was at TASER. He was tasked with a very difficult
assignment of building sales within the corrections sector for the company. I was very impressed with Paul’s
creativeness and commitment to growing this business. Adept at competing for scarce resources, he had the
skill set to not only develop a plan but to execute the plan for success. As the VP of Consumer Sales for
TASER, I recognize the importance of this to the sales process. The ability to both plan and execute while
working with near autonomy earns Paul my highest recommendation. He would be a true asset to any sales
organization."
</p>
<p>— Ralf Engelbrecht, managed Paul indirectly at TASER International
</p>
<p>"Paul Hughes reminds me of some of the most effective executives that I worked with at Intel Corporation,
PepsiCo, and 5.11 Tactical - Paul can work at the CEO level, while constructively building the team, and
working harder than anybody."
</p>
<p>— Brent Jaramillo, worked indirectly for Paul at TASER International
</p>
<p>"Paul is driven, results oriented, and has high standards of integrity."
</p>
<p>— Eric Erickson, MBA, FACHE, studied with Paul at Arizona State University
