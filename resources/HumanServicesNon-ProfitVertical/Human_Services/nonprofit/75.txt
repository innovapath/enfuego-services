Multimedia - Rw fottage editing for short videos
We have many hours and many videos of raw footage from which we would like to edit a new set of short videos. Anywhere from 1-2 minutes based on a topic. This might require voice over. I believe in our programs because in addition to in-depth preliminary research on the ground together with the recipients we also have a solid track record of the impact on the educational achievement of the recipients. Must of all we empower existing local efforts to reach their humanitarian objectives, meaning we invest in the local people human capital to enable them to build their own future. We identify with them the needs and plan with them the paths. It is extremely important for us to continue to build upon the precious know-how in order to empower more kids and more effectively, kids among the most vulnerable, abandoned and enslaved. All the videos that we have are stored on the cloud for easy access, specifically google drive. We have an idea of what topics we would like the new videos to focus on.
This project can be done remotely.
